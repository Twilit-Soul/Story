# Story

I want to start a simple choose-your-own-adventure style program. This will be part coding exercise, 
part-hopefully-something-that-others-enjoy. Interfaced properly, I can worry about a nice UI later on, perhaps.
The story might be stored on file, or database, or hard-coded, I don't know yet.
